## Family Owned, Valley Proud

Homol Construction was founded by Mike Homol, Sr. in 1977. Building in the community was always important to him, and heâ€™s continued that tradition by working alongside his son Jonathan Homol. This family-owned business has been creating, updating, and repairing houses in the Steubenville, Ohio area for over 40 years. Their quality craftsmanship, attention to detail, and good-natured work ethic have earned them the respect of both new and repeat customers throughout the years.

_My husband and I had a sunroom built by Homol Construction last fall. We are extremely pleased with our sunroom. Homol Construction gave us a quality structure at a reasonable cost. They worked with us to create a room that we will enjoy for years to come. We are so glad we chose an honest local business. Definitely would recommend them and hope to work with them again in the future as we do a few remolding projects at our home._
