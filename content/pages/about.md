## Family Owned, Valley Proud

Homol Construction was founded by Mike Homol, Sr. in XXXX. Building in the community was always important to him, and heâ€™s continued that tradition by working alongside his son Jonathan Homol. This family-owned business has been creating, updating, and repairing houses in the Steubenville, Ohio area for over XX years. Their quality craftsmanship, attention to detail, and good-natured work ethic have earned them the respect of both new and repeat customers throughout the years.
